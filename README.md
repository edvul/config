# Configuration to make things go.

`install.sh` runs the whole thing.

This does a few things

1. `brew.sh` installs homwbrew and various things I use.
2. `macos.sh` sets lots of mac defaults to things i prefer.  Lots of these need to be improved a bit.  
3. `dotfiles.sh` rsyncs contents of dotfiles to home.
4. `install.R` has a list of packages to be installed on R (still working on this)

## dotfiles

this is a combination of my own modifications, but mostly borrowed from here:
